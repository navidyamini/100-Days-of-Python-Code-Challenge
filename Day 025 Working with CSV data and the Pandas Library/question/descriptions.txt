we are going to work with data files. CSV and Pandas, we are going to create a game to help us to learn
 all the US states.

Next step, we will work with Squirrel Data.
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw/about_data
1- create a new data frame, count the number of squirrels based on their color, and then save it in a new data frame.

Final Project: US state quiz
we are going to replicate this page:
https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/states
the user should insert the US state's capital, if the answer is right it will appear on the map
