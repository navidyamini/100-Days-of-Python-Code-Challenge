# 100-Days-of-Python-Code-Challenge
Every day until Day 100, one coding challenge will be uploaded.
This repository contains materials related to the 100-day coding challenge course. Each day features a question, and students are encouraged to first try to answer it on their own. After attempting the question, they can then check their code against the provided Python code solution. The course is designed so that each student, after participating in the class, should be able to solve the questions using the materials provided.
