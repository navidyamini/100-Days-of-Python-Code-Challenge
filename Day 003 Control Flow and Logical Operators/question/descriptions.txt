Instructions
Make your own "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. 
Use conditionals such as if, else, and elif statements 
to lay out the logic and the story's path in your program.

Text Snippets from my example
'You're at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right"'
'You've come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake. Type "wait" to wait for a boat. Type "swim" to swim across.'
"You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and one blue. Which colour do you choose?"
"It's a room full of fire. Game Over."
"You found the treasure! You Win!"
"You enter a room of beasts. Game Over."
"You chose a door that doesn't exist. Game Over."
"You get attacked by an angry trout. Game Over."
"You fell into a hole. Game Over."
