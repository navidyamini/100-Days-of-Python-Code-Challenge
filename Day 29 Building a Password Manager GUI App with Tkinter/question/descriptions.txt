Today we will create a password manager.
we are going to use it to store and generate passwords.
1- Create a function called saved().
2- Write the data inside the entries to a data.txt file when the Add button is clicked.
3- Each website, email, and password combination should be on a new line inside the file.
4- All fields need to be cleared after the Add button is pressed.
