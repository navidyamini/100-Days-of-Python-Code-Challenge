We are going to work with Email SMTP and the datetime module, we are going to learn how to send email
using Python code.
At the end we will automate a Happy Birthday message, to send to our friends and family.
# 1. Update the birthdays.csv

# 2. Check if today matches a birthday in the birthdays.csv

# 3. If step 2 is true, pick a random letter from letter templates and replace the [NAME] with the person's actual name from birthdays.csv

# 4. Send the letter generated in step 3 to that person's email address.
